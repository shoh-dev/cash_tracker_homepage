    <h1>Privacy Policy for Simple Cash Tracker</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: August 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Simple Cash Tracker is a minimalist app designed to help you track your personal cash expenses. We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection & Use</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or information from our users.</p>
    <p>The app's core functionality—tracking your expenses—is entirely self-contained on your device. All transaction data, notes, and records are saved locally on your phone and are not uploaded to any server or cloud service.</p>

    <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Simple Cash Tracker does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Because all your data is stored locally on your device, its security is tied to the security of your device. We recommend using device security features like passcodes or biometrics to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
